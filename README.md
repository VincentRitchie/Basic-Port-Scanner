# Basic-Port-Scanner
Basic Port Scanner  This repository contains a Python implementation of a basic port scanner. The port scanner allows users to scan a specified range of ports on a target IP address to identify open ports. The program uses sockets to attempt connections to the specified ports and reports which ports are open.

Features
- Port Scanning: Scan a range of ports on a target IP address to identify open ports.
- Socket Programming: Utilizes Python's socket library for network communication.
- Customizable Port Range: Specify the start and end ports for the scanning range.


Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    PShell
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/port-scanner.git
    cd port-scanner
2. Run the script:
    PShell
    python port_scanner.py
3. Follow the prompts to input the target IP address and the range of ports to scan.

Future Enhancements
Here are some potential future enhancements for the port scanner project, focusing on improving its functionality and usability:

1. Multi-threaded Scanning:
Implement multi-threading to improve the scanning speed by scanning multiple ports concurrently.
Service Detection:
Add functionality to detect and display the service running on each open port (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

2. Banner Grabbing:
Implement banner grabbing to retrieve and display information about the service running on an open port.

3. Output to File:
Add an option to save the scan results to a file (e.g., TXT, CSV, JSON) for later analysis.

4. Command-line Arguments:
Allow users to specify the target IP address, start port, and end port through command-line arguments instead of interactive prompts.

5. Logging:
Implement logging to keep track of scan progress and errors in a log file.

6. Improved Exception Handling:
Enhance exception handling to provide more informative error messages and handle edge cases more gracefully.

7. Interactive Progress Bar:
Add a progress bar to visually indicate the scanning progress.
